i. Compilation and execution instructions
	To compile and execute our code, first run "javac Backend.java", then run "javac Frontend.java".
	You should not need to manually connect to our DB, since the credentials are hardcoded into the backend file.
	To run the program, just run "java Frontend.java".
ii. Workload distribution
	Cade Marks wrote Frontend.java, made the E-E-R diagram, and wrote design.pdf and ReadMe.txt.
	Jacob Egestad wrote Backend.java, tested the code, and debugged the SQL queries.
	There was an even distribution of the workload.
